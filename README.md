## fbJson
JSON Parser written in FreeBASIC

### Why?

The existing parsers written in FB had bugs I could not fix with reasonable effort and I did not like the API. 

Also, it's a nice opportunity to learn something.

### Using it

I do not recommend yet.

### TODO

1) Bring the whole thing into a usable form.

1a) Add type-information to the items.

1b) Have a jsonDocument for the root nodes and jsonItems for everything beneath.

1c) Neat way to access children and values

2) Fix issues with objects in arrays / rethink how arrays are stored.

3) Fix style and naming.
