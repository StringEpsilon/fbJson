## fbJson

A small JSON library written in FreeBASIC

### Why?

The existing parsers written in FB had bugs I could not fix with reasonable effort and I did not like the API. 

Also, it's a nice opportunity to learn something.

### Using it

You can throw a json-string into the constructor of jsonItem and access child elements via item["string"] and item[integer].

I still need to test a bunch of stuff and add bits and pieces, but you can use it to access all data in your json as string.

### TODO

1) Bring the whole thing into a usable form.

2) Fix style and naming.
